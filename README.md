# DeepLearningWithPython
This is a course for BYUI students interested in getting started with Machine Learning topics.

The focus of this course is to use tools such as GitHub, Python, and Google Colab along with Tensorflow and Keras to learn the foundation of Machine Learning. This is done in hopes to have a strong enough understanding to participate in Kaggle competitions. A lot of this information is basied on Francois Challet's Deep Learning With Python. I recommend that anyone participating in this course purchases this book.
